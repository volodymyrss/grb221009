An exceptionally luminous and nearby gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A was observed on 9th of October, 2022 by numerous ground and space telescopes. It was estimated (GCN #32793) that such an even only occurs once in half a millenium, and the chance of it happening in INTEGRAL lifetime was only about 3%. Luminous GRBs sometimes reveal prolonged bright hard X-ray and gamma-ray afterglow, and INTEGRAL was primed to quickly chase this emission, owing to fast follow-up strategy newly optimized for multi-messenger transient counterpart searches.
