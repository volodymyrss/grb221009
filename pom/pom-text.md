An exceptionally luminous and nearby gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A was observed on  the9th of October, 2022 by numerous ground and space telescopes, even those that were not desinged to detect gamma-ray flashes. It was estimated (GCN #32793) that such an even only occurs once in half a millenium, and the chance of it happening in INTEGRAL lifetime was only about 3%. 

Luminous GRBs sometimes reveal prolonged bright hard X-ray and gamma-ray afterglow, and it was previously seen by INTEGRAL to last up to few hours after the event (see GRB 120711A, Martin-Carillo+ 2012). INTEGRAL was well prepared to search for this emission in new bright events. 

Owing to fast follow-up strategy newly optimized for multi-messenger transient counterpart searches, the observation of GRB 221009A started only in a few hours after the ToO trigger.
